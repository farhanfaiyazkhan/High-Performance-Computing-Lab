### How to Compile and Run Code

To run MPI code you need to first install MPICH and then compile using following commands:
```bash
sudo apt install mpich
mpicc main.c -o main
```

To compile OpenMP code, you can use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main -fopenmp
```

To compile POSIX Thread code, you can use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main -pthread
```

Finally, run the compiled executable file created using:
```bash
./main
```
