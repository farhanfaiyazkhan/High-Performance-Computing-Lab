## Matrix Multiplication Performance Analysis

In this practical, you will write a program in C to multiply two matrices of size 1000 x 1000 each and find its execution time using the "time" command. You will also run this program on two or more machines with different configurations to compare execution times and analyze the factors affecting performance.

## Parallel "Hello World" with MPI

In this practical, you will write a parallel program using MPI to print "Hello World" across multiple processes.

## Quick Sort with MPI

In this practical, you will implement the Quick Sort Algorithm using MPI to sort a list of numbers in parallel.

## Multithreaded Fibonacci Series with pThreads

In this practical, you will write a multithreaded program using pThreads to generate the Fibonacci series efficiently.

## Process Synchronization with Mutex Locks using pThreads

In this practical, you will implement process synchronization using mutex locks in a multithreaded environment with pThreads.

## Hello World with OpenMP

In this practical, you will write a "Hello World" program using the OpenMP library and display the number of threads created during execution.

## Multitasking with OpenMP

In this practical, you will write a C program to demonstrate multitasking using the OpenMP library.

## Parallel Calculation of PI/Area of Circle with OpenMP

In this practical, you will write a parallel program using the OpenMP library to calculate the value of PI or the area of a circle.

## OpenMP Loop Scheduling Demonstrations

In this practical, you will write a C program to demonstrate default, static, and dynamic loop scheduling using the OpenMP library.
